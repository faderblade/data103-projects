    "emissions to mitigate the risks associated with climate change. However, mitigating\n",
    "humanity’s impact on climate is a very challenging issue because it is inherently tied to\n",
    "economic, demographic, and technological issues. For instance, there are fears that\n",
    "decarbonization may slow down the economic growth of nations. This is illustrated by Zhao\n",
    "et. al. (2016), who argued that carbon emissions from China and the United States were\n",
    "heavily attributed to the growing demand for manufacturing activities especially in textile\n",
    "products, electrical machinery, and transport equipment. Thus, to prescribe proper\n",

    "Hence, this project will attempt to do the following: \n",

    "1. Analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and different factors using\n",
    "regression models in machine learning\n",
    "2. Evaluate and compare different regression models in terms of performance metrics to be used\n",
    "3. Identify which factors contribute in increasing CO2 emissions\n",
